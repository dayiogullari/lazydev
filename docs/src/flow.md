# User Flow

## For Projects
Repository maintainers first build `Reward Contract`'s by allowing the repositories they want to use in LazyDev_. 

> [!Note]
> LazyDev_ contract is designed to be used with any contract even though we only implemented cw20 and cw721 token reward contracts lazydev.zone UI.
> Developing reward contracts and UI's customized to projects is a part of our business model.

Once it is set up, they configure their repositories by connecting labels with reward contracts.

## For Developers
Developers connect their GitHub accounts and link them to their wallet addresses.

Now, they can click on `Claim Reward` to receive their reward from the corresponding reward contract.

Reward contract assigned to label proceeds the reward distribution to the wallet address connected with Github user.
