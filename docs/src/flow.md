## For Projects

Repository maintainers first build reward contracts by allowing the repositories they want to use in **LazyDev_**.

Once it is set up, they configure their repositories by connecting labels with reward contracts.

The **LazyDev_** smart contract is designed to be used with any contract implementing the requried interface. Currently, we have only implemented basic cw20 and cw721 token reward contracts. Developing custom reward contracts and supporting them in the lazydev.zone UI is part of the future plans for **LazyDev_** as an additional business model.

## For Developers

Developers connect their GitHub accounts and link them to their wallet addresses.

Once connected, they can click on `Claim Reward` to receive their reward from the corresponding reward contract(s) for a pull request.
