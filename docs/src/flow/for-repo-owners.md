# For Repo Owners

If you are an admin in a GitHub repository, you can configure your repository for rewards with **LazyDev\_**.

First, go to <https://lazydev.zone> and then navigate to the *Manage Repos* section, and connect your GitHub account. Any repositories that you have administrator permissions in will show up here. To configure a repository for rewards, you first need to build the rewards. Currently, **LazyDev\_** supports two kinds of rewards: [`token`](../rewards/token.md) and [`nft`](../rewards/nft.md).
